LungTidalSonic is created with a program called "Processing".

The LungTidalSonic Processing source code files have the filename suffix ".pde". They all must reside in a folder named the same as is the intended application name.

Thus for this case all the *.pde source code files must be in a folder named LungTidalSonic.
