# An alternate USB driver name can be placed here.
# LungTidal will try to use the USB driver name you
# place here if it cannot use the one it was compiled
# for. The format is USB:/the driver name
#
# example - USB:/dev/tty.usbserial-A800eGv4
#
# LungTidal shows the USB driver names it finds when it
# cannot find the one for which it is compiled or set here.
# Thus you can set the name for the USB driver it needs to
# look for in this file if you know for sure one of the 
# drivers it lists as detected is in fact the one for the
# Arduino.
