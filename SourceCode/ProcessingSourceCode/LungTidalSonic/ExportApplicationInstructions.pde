/*
As of Processing version 3:

Use File -> Export Application

Pick the platform Mac OS X and make sure to select Embed Java.

Processing will create a folder named "application.macosx". In that
folder will be the exported application.

There will also be a folder called "source". It will contain copies
of the source files and a copy of the java file Processing created.
This can be confusing. That folder and its contents are not needed.
It can be deleted.
